**Connection Goals**
> Every week in 2022, have a meaningful conversation with someone who is dissimilar from me (e.g. in ethnic background, career industry, religious views, stage of life, etc)  
*  **Performance rating: 10/10**
*  Overall, I would say I nailed this resolution. I spent the first half of 2022 primarily in NY challenging myself to meet new people and deepen the new friendships I made since moving there. In the last half of 2022, my time was spent almost entirely in SoCal. Pre-midterm, I spent every weekend in LA with some LA friend groups (Pinoy Big Mouths, Michael/Anna/Raffy, Noograds), and post-midterm I stayed within Fullerton to get more involved in ACM, deepen friendships with students (JAR), and immerse myself more on campus.

> Every week in 2022, talk with a close friend or family outside of New York  
* **Performance rating: 7.5/10**
* I naturally keep conversations alive with group chats and friends outside of New York (and SoCal), but my regularity or consistency is questionable. I could improve this into 2023 by using phone/video calls more as these conversations tend to be more meaningful than the asynchronous messages over text that could take hours or days between replies.

> Continue to invest in my newer friends in NYC. Be grateful for reciprocity.  
* **Performance rating: 9/10**
* Investing in depth of connection and meaningful friendships, whether in NYC or in SoCal, is something I easily do, simply because I genuinely value people in my life immensely. I was deepening my friendships with Millie and Darren especially towards my final few weeks in NYC, and then towards the end of 2022, made close friendships (JAR) in Fullerton that I hope to continue longer-term.


**Passion Goals**
> Every week in 2022, create one piece of content (e.g. piano cover, music production, short form video content, etc) and share with others.  
 > Every week in 2022, create one food post to document a food highlight or memory from that week and share with others.
* **Performance rating: 2/10**
* It went well in the beginning, but after the first few weeks not so much. Time spent on passion projects decreased significantly, to almost nothing since moving to LA - due to the loss of easy access to a music room and severe loss of bandwidth and work-life balance with GIR.
* Admittedly, this may have been an overly ambitious goal since creating content is difficult to roll out quickly given my perfectionism. Still gotta work on this into next year.

> Every week in 2022, read at least one chapter of a book, and upload notes and learnings to https://github.com/AmaJC/library
* **Performance rating: 5/10**
* The first half of the year, with the SAL Book Club in NY, this was going super well! I read awesome books like Crying in HMart and Klara and the Sun with the book club. When I moved to SoCal, reading in my free time stopped, so the last half of the year this goal kinda dropped - hence the 5/10.

> Reach 365 days of learning a language on DuoLingo (current focus: Korean, Hebrew)
* **Performance rating: 10/10**
* Finally reached the 1-year mark on DuoLingo!! (after using countless streak freezes)

**Health + Well Being Goals**
> Every week in 2022, commit to a fitness pomodoro (e.g. do a run with a friend in Central Park or Brooklyn, start training for 5k/NYC half marathon, get a personal trainer at the gym)
* **Performance rating: 6/10**
* The first half of the year, I was working out regularly. I ran early on starting in January with Chad and had some awesome runs across Manhattan/Brooklyn even in the cold of winter when my ears felt like they'd fall off from the cold. Later in the year, I would switch to biking across Manhattan up and down the Hudson River Greenway since that was more fun, easy to do with friends, and you could see more of the city in less time. I got a personal trainer in the NY office and worked out regularly - multiple times a week (alternating push/pull days). I continued in the LA office when I moved in July, but got injured and took a 2 week break that lasted the entire fall semester (oops). I gave up on running because of joint concerns and the time investment needed to prep for a half marathon, deciding ultimately that I'd rather spend my time connecting with others socially than running long distance and hurting my joints.

> Find a therapist.
* **Performance rating: 10/10**
* I found a POC queer therapist based in NY shortly after coming back from winter break. We met virtually and had ~10 sessions of CBT that taught me about thinking traps, self-compassion, radical acceptance, being more mindful, etc. Therapy helped me with reframing and handling friendship issues and family issues more healthily. Graduating also felt really awesome because I definitely had a more positive mindset and outlook at the end of roughly 3 months doing therapy.
* I'd describe my therapy experience in two chapters. My first therapist, in San Ramon, helped validate a lot of the origins of my traumas and problems (mostly centered around childhood experiences). My second therapist, in New York, helped me learn how to respond to present-day situations, now that I know where my tendencies/traumas are rooted in.
