## JC's 2022 New Year Resolutions
**Connection Goals**
• Every week in 2022, have a meaningful conversation with someone who is dissimilar from me (e.g. in ethnic background, career industry, religious views, stage of life, etc)  
>  Goal is to embrace the diversity of NY, broaden my perspectives, challenge my existing values and beliefs, and remember that although it's easy to focus on superficial differences, humans are fundamentally more similar than different from each other.  
 > _Deliverable ideas: journal entry, finsta post to share and reflect learnings_
  
• Every week in 2022, talk with a close friend or family outside of New York  
> Goal is to keep in touch with the people in my life who I deeply care about and love, and to remember I am loved and supported even amidst the loneliness and isolation that's easy to feel after moving to a new city.  
> _Deliverable ideas: video call, phone call_
  
• Continue to invest in my newer friends in NYC. Be grateful for reciprocity.  
> Goal is to engage more with people that I recently met or am getting closer to since moving to NY.  
> _Deliverable ideas: host more in my apartment (e.g. movie nights, board game nights, spam musubi making socials, dumpling night for Chinese New Year), take opportunities to give gifts when a need arises, no occasion needed, initiate music collabs with other musicians/vocalists_
  
 
**Passion Goals**
• Every week in 2022, create one piece of content (e.g. piano cover, music production, short form video content, etc) and share with others.  
> Goal is to prioritize my hobbies better and integrate it into my life more regularly. Since coming back home from NY I've realized how happy music makes me, and the power I have to touch other people with music.
> _Deliverable ideas: post an IG reel/YouTube cover, push a new recording or music remix onto GitHub_
* Every week in 2022, create one food post to document a food highlight or memory from that week and share with others.
> Goal is to document food discovery, be accountable to continued cuisine exploration in NY. Food fosters connection with others. A friend told me recently that they value my food posts because they felt like they were "there experiencing it with you"
> _Deliverable ideas: post about Jewish culture and food on @eatin.with.jc_
* Every week in 2022, read at least one chapter of a book, and upload notes and learnings to https://github.com/AmaJC/library
* Reach 365 days of learning a language on DuoLingo (current focus: Korean, Hebrew)
  
**Health + Well Being Goals**
* Every week in 2022, commit to a fitness pomodoro (e.g. do a run with a friend in Central Park or Brooklyn, start training for 5k/NYC half marathon, get a personal trainer at the gym)
> Goal is to be more fit, gain muscle mass, look and feel better. With the added benefit of exploring more of the city
> _Deliverable ideas: run one of the NYC 2022 half marathons, download Strava to make fitness social, initiate Fitbit challenges_
* Find a therapist.
