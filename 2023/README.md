## JC's 2023 New Year Resolutions
**Connection Goals**
• Focus on **depth** - rather than breadth - in social interactions.
> While meeting new people is still something I should do when I have the opportunity, I want to prioritize the people I have in my life now, and cultivate the valuable relationships I already have, regardless of physical distance.
> _Deliverable ideas: Send and request photos to friends as a way to keep in touch, make time for video/phone calls over asynchronous messaging._

**Passion Goals**
• Learn Japanese! Aim for N4 level - "the ability to understand basic Japanese on daily topics".
> Continuing my love of the pursuit of language learning and prepping for a move to Tokyo one day.
> _Deliverable ideas: finish LingoDeer course, listen to Onomappu YouTube channel, pass JLPT test N4 by EOY, have simple conversations with Japanese friends._

• Content creation
> Documenting memories and sharing them with the world. Food adventures, music content, anything that makes me happy.
> _Deliverable ideas: music, mini vlogs with friends._

**Health + Well Being Goals**
* Establish consistent self care routines - especially skin care and sleep.
> Goal is to take care of myself and my health better for the long-term.
> _Deliverable ideas: aim to sleep 7+ hours daily, daily skin care (am/pm), remember to floss, face mask nights, etc._
* At least twice a week in 2023, commit to a fitness pomodoro.
> Goal is to be more fit, gain muscle mass, look and feel better.  A "fitness pomodoro" could be a work out sesh, a bike ride up the Hudson River Greenway, a hike, a few games of badminton, etc)
> _Deliverable ideas: regular push/pull days or hike on the weekend with JAR_

* Every 2 months in 2023, finish reading a book and document my main takeaways.
> Goal is both for educational and self growth purposes, but also to help limit social media and phone usage at night by reading more at night before sleeping.
> _Deliverable ideas: Write notes on learnings from books @ https://github.com/AmaJC/library_
> Jan/Feb: When Breath Becomes Air
> Mar/Apr: TBD
> May/Jun: TBD
> Jul/Aug: TBD
> Sep/Oct: TBD
